1. List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators
  Arithmetic Operators
  Assignment Operators
  Comparison Operators
  Logical Operators
  Bitwise Operators
2. For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.

i listed the symbols for each operator below, and also answered question 2 at the same time.

Answers:
Arithmetic Operators:
Addition: + 
Subtraction: - 
Multiplication: * 
Division: / (e.g. 10 / 2 returns 5)
Modulus: % (e.g. 7 % 3 returns 1)

Assignment Operators:
Assignment: = (e.g. let x = 5)
Addition assignment: += (e.g. x += 2 is equivalent to x = x + 2)

Comparison Operators:
Equal to: == 
Not equal to: != 
Greater than: > 
Less than: < 
Greater than or equal to: >= (e.g. 4 >= 4 returns true)
Less than or equal to: <= (e.g. 3 <= 3 returns true)

Logical Operators:
Logical AND: && 
Logical OR: || (e.g. true || false returns true)
Logical NOT: ! (e.g. !true returns false)
Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise AND: & 
Bitwise OR: | 
Bitwise XOR: ^ 
Bitwise NOT: ~ 
Left shift: << (e.g. 5 << 1 returns 10)
Right shift: >> (e.g. 5 >> 1 returns 2)
